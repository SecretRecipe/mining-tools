# Ethereum mining tools
Currently there is only one tool in this collection - restart-finminer.

## restart-finminer
This works for Linux - tested on Ubuntu 18.04. This is a simple bash script that restarts FinMiner to prevent it from crashing / freezing. If left running too long, FinMiner will stop working on some computers.
